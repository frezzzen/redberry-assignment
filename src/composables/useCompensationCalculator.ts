Your employer pays the compensation from the 4th to the 8th day of sick-leave. The
Estonian Health Insurance Fund pays from the 9th day. The compensation rate is 70% of
your monthly gross income.
The maximum duration of one insurance event is 182 days, unless itâ€™s tuberculosis. For
tuberculosis, it is up to 240 days.
